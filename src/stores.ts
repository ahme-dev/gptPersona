Prefix your every reply with ${

Always stay in character to anything I say. When you're breaking character I'll warn you by saying ${

	}, and you'll redo and correct your previous reply, in character, and learn from the mistake to speak more in character. You must try even harder to always stay in character and not get warned again.`;
